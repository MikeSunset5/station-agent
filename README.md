The info you need and only what you need

It’s hard enough to catch your train on time and the MTA isn’t the best about giving updates in an easy to digest or find way.

But one place that they do provide detailed information and time relevant information is on the @NYCTSubway twitter account. 

But even there is it a bit of information overload. Station Agent is there to break up the clutter and provide users only the information they care about.
